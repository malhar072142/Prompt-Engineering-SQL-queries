        "- **Two valid approaches** are provided:\n",
        "  - **UNION-based query** using `ORDER BY Rank ASC LIMIT 5` and `ORDER BY Rank DESC LIMIT 5`.\n",
        "  - **Window function-based query** using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER ()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. Completeness**\n",
        "- The query includes **all columns** from `CompanyInfo`, as required.\n",

        "- **Syntax Fixes:** The UNION query should **wrap the subqueries in parentheses properly**.\n",
        "- **Clarify SQL Dialect Requirements:** The output **mentions SQL dialect compatibility**, but a more explicit distinction (e.g., MySQL vs. PostgreSQL) would help.\n",
